         <h1>Hobbies</h1>

         <h2>READING</h2>
         <img src="library.jpg" alt="Library" width="400"> 
         <p>Unlike most of my friends and peers, I was a bookworm.<br>
         My friends would come over to our house to play with me, but they would end up playing with my toys whilst I read books.<br>
         My favourite was <b><em>*Cinderella*</em></b>.<br>
         Even now, I enjoy a good book.</p>
    
         <h2>BIKE RIDING</h2>
         <p>At the age of seven, my dad bought me a bike as a gift for excelling in my studies.<br>
         Riding it up and down the driveway was exciting, however, the most vivid memory I have is of me crashing into the pavement.<br>
         I even spun a full 360 in the air before landing, a moment that felt both terrifying and cinematic.<br>
         The scars from that experience remain, yet it sparked a lasting love for cycling. </p>

         <h1>Toys</h1>

         <h2>DOCTOR SET</h2>
         <img src="doctor set.jpg" alt="Doctor Set" width="400">
         <p>As a young girl, I was captivated by Doc McStuffins, her kindness, her confidence, and her magical ability to heal toys.<br>
         I was convinced I wanted to be just like her.<br>
         Seeing my excitement, my supportive parents bought me a doctor’s set, complete with a tiny stethoscope and bandages.<br>
         I spent hours diagnosing teddy bears and curing imaginary ailments, believing I was destined for medicine.<br>
         Now, years later, I’m an aspiring software developer, a far cry from toy check-ups and plush surgeries.<br>
         If only younger me knew that her dream would quietly evolve into something different, yet equally exciting.<br>
         That doctor set may have gathered dust, but the encouragement behind it still fuels me today.</p>

         <h2>TIGGET THE TIGER</h2>
         <img src="Tigget.jpg" alt="Tigget" width="400">
         <p>I first saw Tigget sitting on a shelf in a toy shop, his orange and black fur glowing under the lights and his stitched smile practically calling my name.<br>
         I fell in love instantly.<br>
         But my mum, ever the <b>practical</b> one, didn’t buy him that day and I left the shop with a heavy heart.<br>
         Then one evening, as she walked in from work, she pulled Tigget out of her bag and my heart leaped.<br>
         I was overjoyed. I hugged him so tightly I thought I’d never let go.<br>
         To this day, Tigget still lives on my bed, a little worn but deeply loved.</p>
